Replace username and password with your own username and password.  Do not use the same username/password that is the same as 
something sensitive, like a website.

Place the file in your data directory. (you need to run the Qt or daemon once before you do this)

If using Linux, the data directory is located at /home/User/.bullion
where User is your login username for your system.

If using Windows, the data directory is located at C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Bullion where USERNAME is replaced with your Windows Username.
